      <h2>My Pets</h2>
        <p>
          I love animals and I have two pets (fur-children?!) of my own.

      <h3>Toby</h3>
      <p>My cat's name is Toby (Tobias when he misbehaves) and I've only had him for three weeks. He's a rescue from <a href="http://www.charlestonanimalsociety.org/" target="_blank">Charleston Animal Society</a> and they estimate that he's about three months old. He's much more friendly and playful than what I expected from a cat and I've even gotten him to play fetch with me!

      <h3>Sergeant</h3>
      <p>Sarge is technically my parent's dog, but I consider him to be mine as well.  One of the saddest things about moving so far away is not getting to see his squishy little face all the time.  He's the worlds friendliest pug and he loves greeting people, sitting on anyones lap and staring you down when you're eating food.
