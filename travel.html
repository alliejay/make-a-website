      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>
        While I certainly haven't traveled the world, I have been fortunate enough to explore some really amazing places.

      <h3>Boston</h3>
      <p>Since I grew up in Foxboro, MA, it's pretty much a given that I've been to Boston. Boston is a great place to visit because it has rich history, beautiful architecture and you can just about walk the entire city, something my husband and I used to do all the time.  This picture was taken during a private flight we took over the city for his birthday.

      <h3>Puerto Rico</h3>
      <p>I love Puerto Rico! My husband and I chose it as our honeymoon destination and it certainly didn't disappoint. We visited Fajardo, which is on the east side of the island, as well as San Juan.  The great thing about Puerto Rico is that you don't need a passport, they use U.S. dollars,
      most people speak English, and it's absolutely stunning!  This picture was taken at the El Conquistador Hotel in Fajardo.

      <h3>New York City</h3>
      <p>New York City is amazing!  While I don't think I could live there due to the excessive hustle & bustle, it's an awesome place for a weekend getaway.  Some of my best friends live in NYC, so I've been able to take trips there often.  This picture shows the view from one of my best friend's bedroom windows.  What a sight to wake up to!

      <img src="img/keywest.jpg" class="itempic"/>
      <h3>Key West</h3>
      <p>Key West is a blast. I came here in 2013 with my husband and his family. It was actually on this trip that he proposed to me. We rented a moped which ended up being one of our favorite parts - it's a great way to explore and see the sights, especially when they're as beautiful as Key West.  This picture was taken at a beach we stopped at during one of these moped rides.

      <h3>New Hampshire</h3>
      <p>I grew up with a summer cottage on Lake Sunapee in NH and my absolute best childhood memories were spent there with my family.  My husband grew up taking ski trips to NH with his family every winter, so we both have a special love for this state (we even got married there!).  This picture was taken on Christmas day in 2012 on the top of Mount Cranmore in North Conway.

      <img src="img/vt.jpg" class="itempic"/>
      <h3>Vermont</h3>
      <p>Vermont is very similar to New Hampshire and is certainly just as beautiful.  While I haven't visited VT nearly as often as NH, I have gotten to explore it a little bit.  For my husband's birthday back in 2012 we took a trip up to Killington, a ski resort, for their annual Brewfest - a celebration of over 100 of the finest craft beers in the region.  This picture was taken at Quechee Gorge on the way up to Killington.
